    <header class="header2">10 THINGS DRUMMERS LEARNED IN 2020</header>
    
    <article>2020: a nice round number. It should’ve been the perfect year to set major goals and make big moves. Many drummers decided at the end of 2019 that 2020 was going to be their year. 

        Well, it was definitely a memorable one – just not in the way we thought.
        
        As we wrap up one of the strangest and possibly most devastating years most of us will encounter in our lifetime, it’s a good opportunity to reflect on some of the things drummers have learned, whether we wanted to or not. 
        
        One of the biggest lessons has been how to adapt. Live public shows were canceled, so we streamed private ‘gigs’ online. We couldn’t meet in-person with teachers or students, so we moved to video calls. And some of us even learned how to record or film ourselves when we didn’t have time before.
        
        While ‘look on the bright side’ isn’t going to make most people feel better, hopefully reading this list will be a small reminder that not all is lost.</article>
